# Currency Converter
Just a simple android currency converter that uses an online API

This android project uses an online API [Free Currency Converter API)[https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/api/v6/convert] to
get the exchage rates. There is a limitation of 100 requests/hour on the free API. Planning to implement some kind of 
caching mechanism to avoid same requests (if i ever work on this project again).
